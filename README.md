# Book-review-app

I made this book review app to take advantage Ember.js Data Fixtures.

This app uses nested resources, and multiple controllers to deliver an interactive and intuitive user experience that displays books, authors, and review details.

With some configuration, this app can be adapted to hook on to a comprehensive book review API or database for practical use.

Please contact me if you have any inquiries or suggestions.  
I would love to hear from you!
